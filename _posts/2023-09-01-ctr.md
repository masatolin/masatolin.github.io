## Overview
**Company:** Toys For Bob<br>
**Time Period:** June - September 2023<br>
**Skills:** Unreal Engine 4, Perforce, C++, Jira, Visual Studio<br>

  - Added damage modifiers that can be changed via gameplay effects so designers can better change player damage through powerups. Using this system, designers can change how much a character can change the damage they receive or deal to opponents.
  - Implemented default knockback so players can get affected by attacks that don't have knockback by default.
  - Fixed bugs relating to hover jump getting stuck on walls, infinite dashing into the air, and prematurely canceling an air boost by double jumping.
  - Worked on optimizing badge loading to prevent out-of-memory crashes on PS4.

### Damage Modifiers
Added damage modifiers that can be changed via gameplay effects so designers can better change player damage through powerups. Using this system, designers can change how much a character can change the damage they receive or deal to opponents. I added 4 Gameplay Attributes for all characters:
1. Damage Dealt Multiplier
2. Damage Dealt Addition
3. Damage Received Multiplier
4. Damage Received Addition

The equation for the total damage would be like so:<br>
`TotalDamage = IncomingDamage * (1 + Instigator.DamageDealtMult + Receiver.DamageReceivedMult) + Instigator.DamageDealtAdd + Receiver.DamageReceivedAdd;`

### Default Knockback
In Crash Team Rumble, some attacks do knockback and some do not. I added the ability to have it so you can be affected by a default knockback when hit by an attack that doesn't have knockback data. This can be set through Gameplay Effects.

Here's a video showing shrunk enemies being knocked back by Crash's spin attack (which doesn't do knockback by default)[^2]

### Ability Bugs
There are two bugs in particular that I will go over:
1. Dingo's Hover Jump
2. Accidental Cancelling of Air Vent

For Dingo's Hover Jump

### Memory Crashes
