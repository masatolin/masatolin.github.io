[_4v4 Team-based Competitive Action Game with Crash Bandicoot Characters_](https://www.crashbandicoot.com/crashteamrumble)

![Picture 1](/assets/Images/CTR_Full.png)

## Overview
**Company:** Toys For Bob<br>
**Time Period:** June - September 2023<br>
**Skills:** Unreal Engine 4, Perforce, C++, Jira, Visual Studio<br>

  - Added damage modifiers that can be changed via gameplay effects so designers can better change player damage through powerups. Using this system, designers can change how much a character can change the damage they receive or deal to opponents.
  - Implemented default knockback so players can get affected by attacks that don't have knockback by default.
  - Fixed bugs relating to hover jump getting stuck on walls, infinite dashing into the air, and prematurely canceling an air boost by double jumping.
  - Worked on optimizing badge loading to prevent out-of-memory crashes on PS4.

### Damage Modifiers
Added damage modifiers that can be changed via gameplay effects so designers can better change player damage through powerups. Using this system, designers can change how much a character can change the damage they receive or deal to opponents. I added 4 Gameplay Attributes for all characters:
1. Damage Dealt Multiplier
2. Damage Dealt Addition
3. Damage Received Multiplier
4. Damage Received Addition

The equation for the total damage would be like so:<br>
`TotalDamage = IncomingDamage * (1 + Instigator.DamageDealtMult + Receiver.DamageReceivedMult) + Instigator.DamageDealtAdd + Receiver.DamageReceivedAdd;`

### Default Knockback
In Crash Team Rumble, some attacks do knockback and some do not. I added the ability to have it so you can be affected by a default knockback when hit by an attack that doesn't have knockback data. This can be set through Gameplay Effects.

Here's a video showing shrunk enemies being knocked back by Crash's spin attack (which doesn't do knockback by default)[^2]

### Ability Bugs
There are two bugs in particular that I will go over:
1. Dingo's Hover Jump
2. Accidental Cancelling of Air Vent

**Dingo's Hover Jump:** Dingo has an ability where he can hover in the air at a fixed height. When he does this and touches a wall, he would be stuck in place until the hover ends. I went through his hover locomotion code and added additional calculations when Dingo is colliding with a surface when hovering. I also made it so when Dingo hovers up a ramp, he doesn't get stuck vertically either.

Here's a simplification of the code.
```cpp
Vector3 dingoMoveVec = m_dingoForwardVec * m_hoverSpeed * deltaTime;
if (collision)
{
   float dotProdHoriz = Vector3.Dot(dingoMoveVec, collision.m_normal);
   Vector3 projectVec = collision.m_normal * dotProd;
   dingoMoveVec -= projectVec;

   dotProdVert = Vector3.Dot(collision.m_normal, Vector3(0,1,0));
   //makes sure we don't change height when on a flat surface
   if(dotProdVert != 1 && dotProdVert != -1)
   {
      dingoMoveVec.z += dotProdVert;
   }
}

m_position += dingoMoveVec
```

**Accidental Cancelling of Air Vent:** There are air vents that push the player up into the air, but it could be canceled if the player double jumped while getting pushed up. I made it so that when the Gameplay Effect for the air vent's effect happened, it would prevent the player from double jumping for a short period of time.

Here's a video showing the air vent in action[^3]

### Memory Crashes
When the game was suspended on PS4 and re-entered on the Party Games Game mode, the game would run out of memory and crash. I helped fix the issue by optimizing what badges were being loaded for each game mode. Badges are rewards given at the end of a match for being outstanding at a task like most points scored.
