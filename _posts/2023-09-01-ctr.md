### Damage Modifiers

  - Added damage modifiers that can be changed via gameplay effects so designers can better change player damage through powerups. Using this system, designers can change how much a character can change the damange they receive or deal to opponents.
  - Implemented default knockback so players can get affected by attacks that don't have knockback by default.
  - Fixed bugs relating to hover jump getting stuck on walls, infinite dashing into the air, prematurely cancelling an air boost by double jumping.
  - Worked on optimizing badge loading to prevent out-of-memory crashes on PS4.
