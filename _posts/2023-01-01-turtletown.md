## Overview
**Time Period:** August 2021 - May 2022<br>
**Skills:** Unity, Perforce, C#, Google Sheets, Visual Studio<br>

- Set up building behaviors, such as shooting buildings, resource buildings, and building upgrades. Architected the classes for attack and resource buildings to make it easier for other engineers to create new attack or resource buildings. Attack buildings allowed the player to shoot at enemies, resource buildings would allow the player to collect higher level resources and increase collection speed, and building upgrades increased the effect of a building.
- Worked on resource collection and resource behaviors. The player can walk near a resource and click on nearby resources to collect them. The number of certain resource buildings affects their collection speed and carrying limit.
- Created smooth scene transitions for the cutscenes at the beginning and end and the team's credits.
