## Overview
**Company:** USC Games Capstone<br>
**Time Period:** August 2022 - May 2023<br>
**Skills:** Unreal Engine 5, Perforce, C++, Google Sheets, Rider<br>

- Developed UI for player stats, health bars, and interactive tutorial popups with feedback from art and design. Tutorial popups can be easily added with a blueprint node to the main quest line blueprint, making it easy for designers to tweak.
- Architected dialogue system for conversations with NPCs with working audio and subtitles. Dialogue lines import a CSV file from a spreadsheet for ease of use for Narrative to add lines and Audio to add voice clips.
- Set up camera shifts to a different angle when in conversation with NPCs.
- Worked on implementing mounted attacks and damage while mounted, expanding on the Ascent Combat Framework plugin.

Below is some gameplay of Manas, showcasing cutscenes, ground combat, and mounted combat:
