## Overview
**Time Period:** January - May 2022<br>
**Skills:** Unity, Github, C#, Google Sheets, Rider<br>

- Implemented player movement and mouse dragging functionality for enemies and items. Lots of tweaking was done so the held objects would track the speed of their movement. That way, fast-moving or thrown objects would cause damage while slowly dragging an object wouldn't.
- Established distinct enemy AI behaviors. One enemy would just come close to attack, one tries to keep their distance to shoot, and one tries to run away quickly after hitting the player. These would work together in situations to create interesting combat scenarios.
- Created a few of the powerups used in the game that would create a shield for the player, and one would induce a rage mode that would increase speed and damage enemies when the player comes close.
- Implemented an explosive prop that could be thrown to damage several enemies at once to add to the more chaotic combat.
- Worked with 2 other teammates to make progress every 2 weeks and create Alpha, Beta, and Gold Master builds.
