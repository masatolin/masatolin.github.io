## Overview
**Company:** Summer Project<br>
**Time Period:** June - July 2022<br>
**Skills:** Unity, Github, C#, Google Sheets, Rider<br>

- Engineered magnetic, momentum-based movement with 3 magnetic point types and 3 hazard types. The magnetic points are how the player can move, either from getting pulled towards a point or pushed away. The different hazards include static spikes, rotating buzzsaws, and a giant angler fish that would chase the player.
- Designed and tuned tutorial levels and chase sequences, collaborating with the Designer and iterating with playtests. Lots of attention was paid to make sure the players would have a fun time navigating the level in interesting ways.
