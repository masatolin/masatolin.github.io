I'm a Game Programmer who's graduating in May 2024. I have industry experience as a Gameplay Programming Intern, but also have worked as a UI and Audio Engineer on capstone projects. I have experience in Unreal Engine and Unity. I love programming for games and want to explore more of it, whether that be UI engineering, gameplay, engine, audio, etc. Feel free to check out my work!
