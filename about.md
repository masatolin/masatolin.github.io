I'm Masato Lin, a Game Programmer graduating in May 2024 with my Master's in Computer Science from USC. My Bachelor's Degree is in Computer Science (Games), also from USC.

My most recent experience is as a Gameplay Engineering Intern for Toys for Bob. I worked on Crash Team Rumble, a Competitive, Character-Based Action Game, where I helped expand on Unreal's Gameplay Ability System to create ways for designers to temporarily change a player's damage or knockback response through Gameplay Effects and optimized Badge Loading to help prevent out-of-memory crashes on PS4. I've also worked as an Engineer for Gameplay and UI for Capstone projects with team sizes of 20+ people using Unreal Engine and Unity.

I got into Video Game Programming as a perfect balance between my strong coding skills and artistic ambitions. I love being able to solve complex problems to tell interesting stories and immerse players in cool experiences.

Other than games, I also have interests in historical cooking, Japanese tea ceremonies, dinosaurs, and linguistics (I'm working on balancing Japanese and Korean at the moment). I also love rabbits for their adorable nature and beavers for their dorkiness.
